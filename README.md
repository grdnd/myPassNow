On startup the user is presented with the password generator interface. When the start button is initiated the user is presented with a prompt on the amount of password characters they desire between 8-128. Then, a set 4 confirmation windows ask the user if they would like to include the specified character type. When at least one of the 4 types are selected, a password is returned and presented to the user.
